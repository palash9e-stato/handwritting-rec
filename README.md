# handwritting-rec

This project performs **handwriting recognition** using a **manually built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained to classify handwritten characters or digits from image data through multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for accuracy and loss. Built with **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib**, the project demonstrates how CNNs can effectively learn visual patterns and can be extended for larger handwriting datasets or real-time recognition applications.
